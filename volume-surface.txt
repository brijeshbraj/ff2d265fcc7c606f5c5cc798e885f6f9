If each interior angle of a regular polygon is 150 degrees, then it is a/an ______________

	Octagon
	Decagon
	Dodecagon
	Tetrahedron
Ans - Dodecagon
The sum of the exterior angle and interior angle of a regular polygon is 3600.

As the measure of each interior angle is 1500, the measure of each exterior angle will be 300.

The number of sides of a regular polygon is given by the following relationship n = 360/exterior angle

As the value of each exterior angle is 300, the number of sides = 12.

Four horses are tethered at 4 corners of a square field of side 70 metres so that they can just about reach one another. The area left ungrazed by the horses is:

	1050 sq.m
	3850 sq.m
	950 sq.m
	1075 sq.m
Ans - 1050 sq.m
The length of the rope in which the horses tied should be equal to half of the side of the square plot so that they just cannot reach one another.

Therefore, the length of the rope is 35m (70/2).

The area covered by each horse should be equal to the area of sector with radius of 70/2 = 35m(length of the rope).

Total area covered by the four horses = 4* area of sector of radius 35 metres = Area of circle of radius 35m.

Area left ungrazed by the horses = Area of square field - Area covered by four horses.

= 702 - (22/7)*35*35 = 4900 - 3850 = 1050 sq.m.

The surface area of the three coterminous faces of a cuboid are 6, 15, 10 sq.cm respectively. Find the volume of the cuboid.

	30 cc
	20 cc
	40 cc
	35 cc
Ans - 30 cc

If the diagonal and the area of a rectangle are 25 m and 168 m2, what is the length of the rectangle?

	17 m
	31 m
	12 m
	24 m
Ans - 24 m
The diagonal d = 25m. and area A = 168 m2.
Let 'l' be the length and 'b' be the width of the rectangle.
Therefore, l2 + b2 = d2. and lb = A
We can therefore write (l + b)2 = d2 + 2A and (l - b)2 = d2 - 2A.
Substituting and solving we get, l + b = 31 and l - b = 17. Hence l = 24 and b = 7

A 4 cm cube is cut into 1 cm cubes. What is the percentage increase in the surface area after cutting?

	4%
	300%
	75%
	400%
Ans - 300%

A solid metal cylinder of 10 cm height and 14 cm diameter is melted and re-cast into two cones in the proportion of 3 : 4 (volume), keeping the height 10 cm. What would be the percentage change in the flat surface area before and after?

	9%
	16%
	25%
	50%
	None of the above
Ans - 50%

A circular road is constructed outside a square field. The perimeter of the square field is 200 ft. If the width of the road is 7v2 ft. and cost of construction is Rs. 100 per sq. ft. Find the lowest possible cost to construct 50% of the total road.

	Rs.70,400
	Rs.1,25,400
	Rs.1,40,800
	Rs.2,35,400
	None of the above
Ans - Rs.1,25,400
