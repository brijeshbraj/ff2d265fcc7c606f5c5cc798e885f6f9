What is a Web Service?
Ans - The Web Services is any services that is available over the internet or intranet networks uses standardized XML messaging system. It is not tied to any operating system or programming language. It is self-describing via a common XML grammar. It is discoverable via a simple find mechanism. 

What are the advantages of Web Services?
Ans - Interoperability: Web services are accessible over network and runs on HTTP/SOAP protocol and uses XML/JSON to transport data, hence it can be developed in any programming language. Web service can be written in java programming and client can be PHP and vice versa.
Reusability: One web service can be used by many client applications at the same time.
Loose Coupling: Web services client code is totally independent with server code, so we have achieved loose coupling in our application.
Easy to deploy and integrate, just like web applications.
Low Cost of Communication
Multiple service versions can be running at same time.

What are major rolls of web services architecture?
Ans - There are three major rolls of web services architecture:
	Service Provider - The service provider implements the service and makes it available on the Internet.
	Service Requestor - The requestor utilizes an existing web service by opening a network connection and sending an XML request.
	Service Registry - The registry provides a central place where developers can publish new services or find existing ones. It therefore serves as a centralized clearing house for companies and their services.
	
What are different web services component?
XML-RPC
SOAP
WSDL
UDDI

OOPs
What is Object Oriented Programming?
	Object-oriented programming is an approach to programming where objects and classes are used. Object-Oriented PHP helps your code stay flexible by allowing it to be only defined once but used in many places.	The goals of object-oriented programming are Increased understanding, Ease of maintenance. Ease of evolution.
	
Basic concept of OOPs?
	Abstraction.
	Encapsulation. 
	Inheritance. 
	Polymorphism.
	
What is MVC?
	The model view controller pattern is the most used pattern for today’s world web applications. At present there are more than a dozen PHP web frameworks based on MVC pattern.The MVC pattern separates an application in 3 modules: Model, View and Controller:
	Model - The model is responsible to manage the data; it stores and retrieves entities used by an application, usually from a database, and contains the logic implemented by the application.
	View - The view (presentation) is responsible to display the data provided by the model in a specific format. It has a similar usage with the template modules present in some popular web applications, like wordpress, joomla, …
	Controller - The controller handles the model and view layers to work together. The controller receives a request from the client, invokes the model to perform the requested operations and sends the data to the View. The view formats the data to be presented to the user, in a web application as an html output.
	
What is Polymorphism?
	Polymorphism is the process of using an operator or function in different ways for different data input. In practical terms, polymorphism means that if class B inherits from class A, it doesn’t have to inherit everything about class A; it can do some of the things that class A does differently.

	In general, polymorphism is the ability to appear in different forms. Technically, it is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes. Polymorphism is concerned with the application of specific implementations to an interface or a more generic base class.
	
What is the Scope Resolution Operator?
	The Scope Resolution Operator is a token that allows access to static, constant, and overridden properties or methods of a class. When referencing these items from outside the class definition, use the name of the class.

What is difference between class and interface?
	1)Interfaces do not contain business logic .
	2)You must extend interface to use.
	3)You can't create object of interface.

How to load classes in PHP?
	We can load a class with the use of "autoload" class.
	If we want to change from default function autoload to testautload function.
	we can do this with "spl_autoload_register"	
	spl_autoload_register('class_name');
	
What happen, If constructor is defined as private OR protected.
	If constructor declared as private, PHP through the following fatal error when create object. Fatal error: Call to private BaseClass::__construct() from invalid context in. If constructor declared as protected, PHP through the following fatal error when create object. Fatal error: Call to protected BaseClass::__construct() from invalid context in.
	
What is Static Keyword in PHP?
	If we declare a Method or Class Property as static, then we can access that without use of instantiation of the class.
	Static Method are faster than Normal method.
	$this is not available within Static Method.
	Static properties cannot be accessed through the object(i.e arrow operator)
	Calling non-static methods with Scope Resolution operator, generates an E_STRICT level warning.
	Static properties may only be initialized using a literal or constant value.
	Static properties/Normal properties Can't be initialized using expressions value.	

What is Abstraction in PHP?
	Abstraction are defined using the keyword abstract .
	PHP 5 introduces abstract classes and methods. Classes defined as abstract may not be instantiated (create object).
	To extend the Abstract class, extends operator is used.
	You can inherit only one abstract class at one time extending.
	Any class that contains one abstract method must also be declare as abstract. Methods defined as abstract simply declare the method's signature, they can't define the implementation.
	All methods marked as abstract in the parent's class, declaration must be defined by the child.
	Additionally, these methods must be defined with the same (or a less restricted) visibility (Public,Protected & private).
	Type hint & number of parameter must be match between parent & child class.
	
What is Interface in PHP?
	Interfaces are defined using the interface keyword.
	All methods declared in an interface must be public. Classes defined as Interface may not be instantiated(create object).
	To extend the interface class, implements operator is used.
	You can inherit number of interface class at the time of extending and number of abstract class separated by comma.
	All methods in the interface must be implemented within a child class; failure to do so will result in a fatal error.
	Interfaces can be extended like classes using the extends operator.
	The class implementing the interface must use the exact same method signatures as are defined in the interface. Not doing so will result in a fatal error.
	Type hint & number of parameter must be match.
	
What is Traits in PHP?
	Traits are a mechanism for code reuse in single inheritance.
	A Trait is similar to a class, but only intended to group functionality in a fine-grained and consistent way. 
	It is not possible to instantiate a Trait but addition to traditional inheritance. It is intended to reduce some limitations of single inheritance to reuse sets of methods freely in several independent classes living in different class hierarchies.
	Multiple Traits can be inserted into a class by listing them in the use statement, separated by commas(,).
	If two Traits insert a method with the same name, a fatal error is produced.
	
What is Final Keyword in PHP?
	PHP introduces the final keyword, which prevents child classes from overriding a method by prefixing the definition with final.
	If the class itself is being defined final then it cannot be extended. If the function itself is being defined final then it cannot be extended. 
	
What is difference between $this & self?
	$this is used to reference the current object, whereas self is used to access the current class itself. In other words, use $this->member for non-static members, use self::$member for static members.
What's the difference between :: (double colon) and -> (arrow) in PHP?
	There are two distinct ways to access methods in PHP. The double colon operator (::) is for static elements. This means an instance of the object has not been created yet. while The arrow operator(->) is for instance elements. 

Why we call parent constructor?
	Parent constructors are not called implicitly if the child class defines a constructor. In order to run a parent constructor, a call to parent::__construct() within the child constructor is required. If the child does not define a constructor then it may be inherited from the parent class just like a normal class method (if it was not declared as private).
	
What is Constructor?
	A constructor is a special kind of a method. It is automatically called when the object is created. The purpose of the constructor is to initiate the state of the object. The name of the constructor in PHP is __construct() (with double underscores).
Types of Constructors
	There are 3 type of constructor in php - 
	Default - __construct() is not declared, then uses default. By default it is non-Parameterized.
	Parameterized - __construct() is declared with parameter:
	Copy - __clone(). it is used to create copy one.
	
Define Destructor?
	Destructor method will be called as soon as there are no other references to a particular object, or in any order during the shutdown sequence.
