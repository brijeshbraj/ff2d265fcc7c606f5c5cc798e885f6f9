What is a Web Service?
Ans - The Web Services is any services that is available over the internet or intranet networks uses standardized XML messaging system. It is not tied to any operating system or programming language. It is self-describing via a common XML grammar. It is discoverable via a simple find mechanism. 

What are the advantages of Web Services?
Ans - Interoperability: Web services are accessible over network and runs on HTTP/SOAP protocol and uses XML/JSON to transport data, hence it can be developed in any programming language. Web service can be written in java programming and client can be PHP and vice versa.
Reusability: One web service can be used by many client applications at the same time.
Loose Coupling: Web services client code is totally independent with server code, so we have achieved loose coupling in our application.
Easy to deploy and integrate, just like web applications.
Low Cost of Communication
Multiple service versions can be running at same time.

What are major rolls of web services architecture?
Ans - There are three major rolls of web services architecture:
	Service Provider - The service provider implements the service and makes it available on the Internet.
	Service Requestor - The requestor utilizes an existing web service by opening a network connection and sending an XML request.
	Service Registry - The registry provides a central place where developers can publish new services or find existing ones. It therefore serves as a centralized clearing house for companies and their services.

Minimum no Of Aircraft Puzzle

On Bagshot Island, there is an airport. The airport is the home base of an unlimited number of identical airplanes. Each airplane has a fuel capacity to allow it to fly exactly 1/2 way around the world, along a great circle. The planes have the ability to refuel in flight without loss of speed or spillage of fuel. Though the fuel is unlimited, the island is the only source of fuel.
What is the fewest number of aircraft necessary to get one plane all the way around the world assuming that all of the aircraft must return safely to the airport? How did you get to your answer?

Notes:

(1) Ignore extra fuel consumption as a result of acceleration, evaporation of fuel, bleeding-heart-liberal fiscal policies, etc.
(2) All the planes have to make it back safely, so you can’t give all your fuel away to another plane.
(3) Assume that refueling is an extremely fast process.


Red and Blue Balls in a Bag

You have 20 Blue balls and 10 Red balls in a bag. You put your hand in the bag and take off two at a time. If they’re of the same color, you add a Blue ball to the bag. If they’re of different colors, you add a Red ball to the bag. What will be the color of the last ball left in the bag?

Note: Assume you have a big supply of Blue and Red balls for this purpose. When you take the two balls out, you don’t put them back in, so the number of balls in the bag keeps decreasing.

Once you tackle that, what if there are 20 blue balls and 11 red balls to start with?


King and Wine Bottles
A bad king has a cellar of 1000 bottles of delightful and very expensive wine. A neighboring queen plots to kill the bad king and sends a servant to poison the wine. Fortunately (or say unfortunately) the bad king’s guards catch the servant after he has only poisoned one bottle. Alas, the guards don’t know which bottle but know that the poison is so strong that even if diluted 100,000 times it would still kill the king. Furthermore, it takes one month to have an effect. The bad king decides he will get some of the prisoners in his vast dungeons to drink the wine. Being a clever bad king he knows he needs to murder no more than 10 prisoners – believing he can fob off such a low death rate – and will still be able to drink the rest of the wine (999 bottles) at his anniversary party in 5 weeks time. Explain what is in mind of the king, how will he be able to do so ? (of course he has less then 1000 prisoners in his prisons)

Measure 4 gallon of water from 3 gallon and 5 gallon water jar

How to measure exactly 4 gallon of water from 3 gallon and 5 gallon jars, Given, you have unlimited water supply from a running tap.


How to measure exactly 4 Litre water using jar of 5 Litre & 3 Litre. You have unlimited water supply from a running water.

Solution - 
Step 1. Fill 3 gallon jar with water. ( 5 litre jar =  0, 3 litre jar = 3 litre)
Step 2. Pour all its water into 5 litre jar. (5 litre jar = 3 litre, 3 litre jar = 0)
Step 3. Fill 3 litre jar again. (5 litre jar = 3 litre, 3 litre jar = 3 litre)
Step 4. Pour its water into 5 litre jar untill it is full. Now you will have exactly 1 litre water remaining in 3 litre jar. (5 litre jar = 5 litre, 3 litre jar = 1 litre)

Step 5. Empty 5 gallon jar, pour 1 gallon water from 3 gallon jar into it. Now 5 gallon jar has exactly 1 gallon of water. (5p – 1, 3p – 0)

Step 6. Fill 3 gallon jar again and pour all its water into 5 gallon jar, thus 5 gallon jar will have exactly 4 gallon of water. (5p – 4, 3p – 0)
