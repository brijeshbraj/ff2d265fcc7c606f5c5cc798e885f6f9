What are the advantages of Web Services?
Ans - Interoperability: Web services are accessible over network and runs on HTTP/SOAP protocol and uses XML/JSON to transport data, hence it can be developed in any programming language. Web service can be written in java programming and client can be PHP and vice versa.
Reusability: One web service can be used by many client applications at the same time.
Loose Coupling: Web services client code is totally independent with server code, so we have achieved loose coupling in our application.
Easy to deploy and integrate, just like web applications.
Low Cost of Communication
Multiple service versions can be running at same time.

What are major rolls of web services architecture?
Ans - There are three major rolls of web services architecture:
	Service Provider - The service provider implements the service and makes it available on the Internet.
	Service Requestor - The requestor utilizes an existing web service by opening a network connection and sending an XML request.
	Service Registry - The registry provides a central place where developers can publish new services or find existing ones. It therefore serves as a centralized clearing house for companies and their services.

The goals of object-oriented programming are Increased understanding, Ease of maintenance. Ease of evolution.
	
Basic concept of OOPs?
	Abstraction.
	Encapsulation. 
	Inheritance.

What is MVC?
	The model view controller pattern is the most used pattern for today’s world web applications. At present there are more than a dozen PHP web frameworks based on MVC pattern.The MVC pattern separates an application in 3 modules: Model, View and Controller:
	Model - The model is responsible to manage the data; it stores and retrieves entities used by an application, usually from a database, and contains the logic implemented by the application.
	View - The view (presentation) is responsible to display the data provided by the model in a specific format. It has a similar usage with the template modules present in some popular web applications, like wordpress, joomla, …
	Controller - The controller handles the model and view layers to work together. The controller receives a request from the client, invokes the model to perform the requested operations and sends the data to the View. The view formats the data to be presented to the user, in a web application as an html output.
	
What is Polymorphism?
	Polymorphism is the process of using an operator or function in different ways for different data input. In practical terms, polymorphism means that if class B inherits from class A, it doesn’t have to inherit everything about class A; it can do some of the things that class A does differently.

	In general, polymorphism is the ability to appear in different forms. Technically, it is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes. Polymorphism is concerned with the application of specific implementations to an interface or a more generic base class.
	
What is the Scope Resolution Operator?
